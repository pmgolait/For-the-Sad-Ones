# for the lonely ones
It's a simple project I made back in grade 9... [NOT MY IDEA, inspired by a similar project I came across]

The moving black box represents an individual and the other grey boxes represents people and society as a whole.. the first detail lies in the color difference (which in no manner represents or is supposed to represent racism) which is symbolic of the difference in personalities of the individual and other people.. more the black box tries to get closer to grey boxes, the more they repel.. this goes on for a while until another black box appears out of no where and contrary to the grey boxes, this new black box is not running away, instead it is there standing as if it's waiting for someone like itself.. and when the two boxes merge.. the game ends.
The background also changes with time.. from dark colored to light colored, which symbolizes the environmental and intrinsic change a person goes through as time passes and reflects the quote that time "heals everything".
The music is kind of a sad tone which sets the environment for the game and symbolizes the internal agony of the individual.
